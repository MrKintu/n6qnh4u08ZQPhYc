Data Overview
The dataset used in this analysis is Car_Details_original.csv, which contains the following features:

Type: Type of the car (e.g., SUV, Sedan)
Origin: Origin of the car (e.g., Asia, Europe)
DriveTrain: Type of drivetrain (e.g., Front, All)
EngineSize: The size of the engine
Cylinders: Number of cylinders
Horsepower: Horsepower of the car
MPG_City: Miles per gallon in the city
MPG_Highway: Miles per gallon on the highway
Weight: The weight of the car
Wheelbase: The wheelbase of the car
Length: Length of the car
MSRP: Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (target variable)
Data Preparation
The notebook begins by importing the necessary libraries and loading the dataset. It then performs the following steps:

Data cleaning: Removing unnecessary columns and handling missing values.
Feature selection: Defining the feature variables (X) and the target variable (Y).
Model Training
The model training process involves:

Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Training a machine learning model (e.g., Linear Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes) using the training data.
Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
Results
The notebook includes visualizations such as learning curves to assess the model's performance and to understand how well the model generalizes to unseen data.

Conclusion
This analysis demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to predict car prices based on various features. The model's performance metrics indicate its effectiveness in making price predictions.
